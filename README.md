# Aaeditor

This is very basic rich text box editor developed using javascript & angular. `richeditor` is a angular directive.
it will transform the html container tags (`div`) into an editor.

sample :`<div richeditor ></div>`


## Possible improvement
  Well this is very basic component. development completed in very minimal time . 

* use scss variables & more granular scss rules.
* different parser (html,json) can be implement .
* font-awesome dependency should include via npm .



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
